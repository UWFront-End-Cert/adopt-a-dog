          <h3>Traveling With Your Dog</h3>
          <p>
            I fell in the mud as I was walking home from school today.
            I wanted to flirt with the barista, but suddenly, I couldn't find my tongue.
            I like blueberries and mangoes but not strawberries.
            Suddenly from under the stove there came a squeak.
          </p>
          <p>
            I didn't know what to wear to my best friend's funeral.
            I'm taking a little road trip to Oklahoma City this morning.
            Tom realized he could be making a big mistake.
            He had a dream so real that he woke screaming.
