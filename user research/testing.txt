Summary

Overall, AdoptaDog worked well across all browsers and devices. The pages loaded as expected and JavaScript/jQuery executed their actions as expected. The opportunity to test this site across multiple browsers and devices did provide insight to areas in which CSS needed to be updated, especially on Microsoft Edge. One error did occur on Safari browser, with the following message appearing in the console after 'Submit' was clicked on with a complete form: favicon load local resource error. This data error will be evaluated in further detail, as it did not seem to inhibit the code or user experience. Based on this evaluation, AdoptaDog is ready for publication.
