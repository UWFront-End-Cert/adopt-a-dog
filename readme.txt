Adopt-A-Dog

A Seattle-based dog adoption website


DESCRIPTION:

Adopt-A-Dog is written using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and runs on, at least, Windows 10 using Chrome and Firefox, and iOS using Safari Mobile.

It contains a list of dogs which users can adopt, as well as information about the dog such as their breed and adoption fees.  There is a check-out form for online ordering.

Additionally, the site includes a Dog Blog for sharing information for instance about training your dog, walking multiple dogs, and implications of travel.


TESTING:

This site was designed and tested based on three User Personas developed according to research into likely site users.  This led the developer to test the website on platforms including Windows 10 and iOS.  A full testing log and the changes that were made as a result can be found at:
