Adoptadog runs on Windows and Ubuntu Linux. It runs especially good on iOS. It is compatible with major browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge and iOS Safari.

It is built as a project for me to further my skills in HTML and CSS, and to learn website responsiveness and Javascript.

The made-up content is about providing dog adoption service particularly for those who live in Pacific Northwest. It has a homepage, a dog profile page, a blog page and a contact page.
