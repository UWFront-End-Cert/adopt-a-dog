## Testing

Our website's goal is to be accessible and easy to use. The website should be viewable on functional on all devices, regardless of size or operating system. We created a few user personas with different scenarios and background to cater our website to.

Then we went and tested the functionality on several different browsers and devices. We will be using Windows 10 with Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Internet Explorer. We will also use a Macbook Pro from 2013 with Safari and Google Chrome. In addition to using the developer tools on Chrome, we will test the webiste on Android OS and iOS.

### Browsers:

_Google Chrome_: Works as intended as it was developed on Chrome. All functionality with buttons, resizing, javascript, and event handlers work.

_Firefox_: Some things didn't work as expected with grids, so changes were made to the css, but now works as intended.

_Safari_: Works well on Safari, hover effects work, buttons and javascript works as intended. No issues with layout or css at all.

_Edge_: No issues found on Edge and all functionality works as expected.

_Internet Explorer_: Website loads all images, but not as they were intended to be viewed on the browser.

### Operating Systems:

No issues were found on either iOS or Windows.

### Mobile Devices:

_Android 12 (Pixel 5)_: Website works on mobile and properly scales with respect to screen size. Buttons work as intended. However on the available dogs page, each cell for the dogs are smaller than I would like. I can take some steps to update than using media queries on the class.

_iOS 14.4 (iPad mini 4)_: No issues found with Safari on iOS other than visuals. The buttons were changed from the flat, green, rounded rectangle button to a three-dimensional long pill button. center column doesn't seem to be centered as the margin on the right is far greater than the margin on the left.

_Other Mobile devices_: I don't have access to larger phones/mobile devices, so I used Google Chrome's developer tools to emulate a larger tablet. I didn't have any issues. The dog grids correctly change the columns as expected. Buttons and events worked well.
