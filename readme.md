## Features/Experience Showcase

The site will be designed for mobile devices first, with clear header and footer styling consistent on each page. On the landing page, an immediate path to adoption will be most prominent, with links below to the blog page and the dog profiles page. The user will be channeled to a checkout page when the user has added a dog to the cart and selects the checkout option.
