User Personas
	The user base for the course project is anyone interested in adopting a dog.
  This could be a young college student just starting out, a single adult, a family,
  or an older person looking to find a dog.  Because of this, there could be a wide
  range of devices used to access the site, including desktops, laptops, tablets,
  and mobile devices.

	A young college student, for example, is probably going to have extensive knowledge
  on using and accessing technology.  They will have and know how to navigate some of
  the newest devices and most likely have fast internet.

	An older person, on the other hand, might not have the most up to date devices
  and might have slower internet access depending on whether they live in the city
  or a rural community.  Their knowledge of technology and navigating a website will
  not be as extensive and they may need to have an easier to use layout with easily
  clickable links and buttons.
