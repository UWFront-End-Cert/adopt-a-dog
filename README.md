# HTML200-adopt-a-dog | Course Project

This is the final project of the second course of the University of Washingtonâ€™s Front End Web Development Program. This website was built using HTML5, CSS3, JS and JQuery.  

# Project Purpose

The purpose of this project was to utilize skills learned in this front end development class. Using a mockup as a visual reference, the skeleton of the site was built using HTML and styled with CSS. After this, Javascript and JQuery were used to add responsiveness to the site. Buttons, hover functionality and text loading were used to modify the website to work on various browsers, mobile and tablet devices.

# Site Purpose

Adoptadog.com is a website that helps users browse dogs that are available for adoption and facilitate the adoption process. This website is designed to streamline the process of adopting a dog and provide information about the dog prior to adoption so prospective owners can learn about the dog in particular. It also features a blog with handy information for current and prospective owners, helping them with the transition to dog parenthood. Shelter dogs are frequently returned as owners often do not know enough about the dog prior to adoption, so having this information readily available helps the prospective dog parent confident about adopting the perfect addition to their family!
