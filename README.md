Description
The purpose of this site is to help Adoptadog reach potential adopters online, whether on a phone, tablet, or desktop device.

User personas
Users for the site are adults over 18 in the Seattle area. Because the site is new, we don't have analytics history for the specific users of the site. We can collect that over time and test on different browsers and devices. 
For now, we tested for commonly used browsers and devices in the United States that would fit these user personas.
-User Katherine is a busy 45-year-old mom who is looking for a second family dog. She peruses dog adoption sites during her kids' soccer games on her iPhone.
-Users Sally and Charles are getting their first dog together.
They look at dogs on their desktop PC so they can browse together. Because they are going to be new dog owners, they are taking their time to do their research and will access the Adoptadog blog for tips on dog ownership.
-User Hawk is a single person who looks at dogs on their laptop. Hawk is blind and will use a screen reader. 
They will use the skip link to dive into the content. They find the detailed alt descriptions of the dog photos to be valuable in their search.
