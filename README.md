# html200-adopt-a-dog

## Description
Adopt-a-dog was created with the intention of helping people find and adopt rescue dogs. It also serves as an informative website that has blog posts that offer helpful advice to current dog owners as well as those looking to adopt. This project was written using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and jQuery.

## User persona
The primary user persona that I would expect for this website is: 
* People that are generally accessing the website via a desktop or laptop computer using Chrome or Safari. 
* They have the time, space and finances to devote to the care of the dog. 
* Their job allows them to work from home or they usually work an 8 hour day. 
* They live in a house if they are interested in a larger dog or an apartment if they are looking for a smaller dog.
* They are not allergic to dogs and live somewhere that permits them to own a dog. 
* They know the general qualities of the breed of dog they are looking for. 
* They are willing to take the time and put in the effort to train the dog, if need be.
