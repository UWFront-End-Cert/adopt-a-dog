Adoptadog is a dog adoption website that lists the profiles of dogs currently up for adoption. It also hosts a blog that hosts content targeted towards dog owners.

Adoptadog uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript to allow users to place orders to adopt dogs and complete payments through the website.

Our site was designed with the mobile experience in mind, as being able to seamlessly browse from your phone and receive push notifications are necessary for users who are looking for the right furry addition to their home.

Paws animal shelter in Lynwood, WA serves as a reasonable comp for this site's scope: https://www.paws.org/
