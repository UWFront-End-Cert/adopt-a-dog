# html200-adopt-a-dog
Thank you for your interest in the website. Before I start describing the website I want to point out that to access the published link /1st-page has to be added in the link to
succesfully open the page since I have all the files in the repository inside that spesific folder.

This website is composed of four pages in which the majority of the code is done through html. 
The index.html is the Home page where you can see the introduction of the website and some of the dogs for adoption with a preview of the dogs blog page on the right side.
In the dogs page you can see all the dogs avilable with their name below their pictures. 

On the third page there is a blog with some tips to have the best experiences
with your dog when traveling, teaching your dog how to fetch and walking with multiple dogs at once. The format for the blog has three pictures in a row with the
information in a paragraph beside each picture. Also there is a testing.txt file with the personas description and some testing that was done on the website.   

And the last page is the check-out form requesting the adopters information to start the process of the adoption.  Also there is a testing.txt file with the personas description 
and some testing that was done on the website. I hope you like the information, feel free to use any code as needed. And if you see something that can be improved it will be
really nice to see the changes.
