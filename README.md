# [Adoptadog](https://jordanmollot.github.io/html200-adopt-a-dog/)
*A Seattle-based dog adoption website*

## Description

The Adoptadog website is currently written in html, but I will soon be adding CSS and JavaScript. It was built to run on MacOSX and Windows in the 4 most popular desktop web browsers- Safari, Chrome, Firefox and Edge. For mobile devices, it is built to run in Safari on the iPhone/iPad and run in Chrome on Android smart phones. The website serves as database of all the current dogs available for adoption and allows users pick out dogs to adopt and purchase them. It also serves as a resource for prospective dog owners to learn about the adoption process, as well as, resources on taking care of dogs and training them.
