# Adopt-a-dog
*Mike Watters HTML200 Class Project*

## Description

The purpose of this site is to help Adoptadog reach potential adopters online,
whether on a phone, tablet, or desktop device.

## User personas

Users for the site are adults over 18 in the Seattle area. Because the site is
new, we don't have analytics history for the specific users of the site. We can
collect that over time and test on different browsers and devices. For now, we
tested for commonly used browsers and devices in the United States that would
fit these user personas.

* User Kathy is a busy 45-year-old mom who is looking for a second family dog.
She peruses dog adoption sites during her kids' soccer games on her iPhone.

* Users Kevin and Charlene are getting their first dog together. They look at
dogs on their desktop PC so they can browse together. Because they are going to
be new dog owners, they are taking their time to do their research and will
access the Adoptadog blog for tips on dog ownership.

* User Terry is a single person who looks at dogs on their laptop. Terry is
blind and will use a screen reader. They will use the skip link to dive into the
content. They find the detailed alt descriptions of the dog photos to be
valuable in their search.
