# html200-adopt-a-dog

Description:

This site is designed to facilitate the adoption of dogs in need of a forever home. We feature pictures and details of dogs available for adoption. 

User Persona: 

According to https://www.packagedfacts.com/Pet-Population-Ownership-10858348/ the primary demographics most likely to adopt:
* 18-34 years old
* +70 
* 2nd & 3rd genteration Lations

From this information we should conclude that the younger cohort will be using a variety of hand held devices. 
The aging boomers are probably using desktop and laptop devices with a good potential for out-of-date browsers.
The Latino-Americans could possibly require translated pages.

It is also evident that at the very least we will want to include a link or links to good information about what is required
as a pet owner. The following link is a good example  https://news.orvis.com/dogs/pet-adoption-statistics-the-numbers-behind-the-need.
