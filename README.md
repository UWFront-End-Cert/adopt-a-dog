The CSS of Blog's page is now linked to the main stylesheet page, located in the same folder 'styles', name of the file: 'style.css'.

In the 'scripts' folder there are two JavaScript files, one of them is the main one which is linked to 'index.html' and 'dogs.html'. So, 'script-two.js' is the result of making another alternative program to run pages but I definitely chose the first attempt, 'script.js'

I committed some updates on pages 'index.html' and 'dogs.html' because I used the attribute 'charset' and its value of 'utf-8' wrapped in the script tag located within head element. After the validation process, the validator pointed a warning related of that issue, which it said that 'it is deprecated or obsolete'. So, I figured out the idea of using the attribute 'charset' would work inside the 'body' and in order to avoid some errors, this attribute must be omitted.

Forgot to mention the styling I have been added on images, buttons and links. Some hover effects to break a little bit the 'static' on pages.
