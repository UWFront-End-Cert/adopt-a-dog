# Adopt-a-Dog, Seattle’s premiere dog adoption agency

Adopt-a-Dog website is a Course Project for the HTML5200 JavaScript & Responsive Design course from the University of Washington. The objective of the Course Project was to build a "functional, robust website from scratch" using the supplied adopt-a-dog-mockup comps, images, and logo.

Over the course of ten lessons, you learn to create the HTML, CSS, and the JavaScript functionality. The code is hosted on my student GitHub page and pull requests made to the courses repository to compare my master branch against the course's repository.

# User Persona
