Adopt-A-Dog

Description
This sight was written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  

This website was made in order to learn how to code during the UW certification course.  If this was a real website it would be used to help people find their very best dog companions easily and as painless as possible.

The website can be accessed and used on multiple devices from phones to tablets to computers.
