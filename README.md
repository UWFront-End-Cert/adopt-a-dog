Adopt-A-Dog
~An Online Dog Adoption Database serving the Pacific Northwest~

DESCRIPTION
Adopt-A-Dog provides online adoption opportunities for people located in the Seattle-Tacoma area and the greater PNW.
In addition to providing an up-to-date database of dogs available for immediate adoption, the site hosts a blog for current
and prospective dog owners to share in the collection experience of having a fur companion.

After researching the community it aims to serve and potential user personas for likely online traffic, a set of goals was
defined. The website's primary goals are:
- to be easily navigable by users with a breadth of technological literacy
- to be accessible to people using a wide variety of devices and accessibility aids running various operating systems
and internet browsers
- to effectively achieve its objective of facilitating pet adoptions with simple yet robust functionality

Three specific user personas were designed and used to inform the approach to functional testing. Since the site aims to serve
a diverse community, extensive testing was performed on Mac and PC operating systems using Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge
browsers. Testing was also performed on a variety of mobile device sizes and operating systems. Specifics of user personas
as well as the testing process and outcomes are detailed in testing.txt.
