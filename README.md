# Adopt-a-Dog, Seattle’s premiere dog adoption agency

Adopt-a-Dog website is a Course Project for the HTML5200 JavaScript & Responsive Design course from the University of Washington. The objective of the Course Project was to build a "functional, robust website from scratch" using the supplied adopt-a-dog-mockup comps, images, and logo.

Over the course of ten lessons, you learn to create the HTML, CSS, and the JavaScript functionality. The code I have hosted on my student GitHub page and pull requests made to the courses repository to compare my master branch against the course's repository.

This Adopt-a-Dog website was created by Janene Smith, Winter quarter 2022 (https://janene-smith.github.io/html200-adopt-a-dog/).
