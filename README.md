Adoptadog: Seattle's premiere dog adoption agency

Description

This site was written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript and references jQuery. It was designed to be responsive at all breakpoints and includes unique stylesheets for mobile, tablet and desktop. The site was created as a place for visitors to learn both about the agency itself and about each dog that is available for adoption through them in the Seattle area. Additionally, adoptions can be made online using the checkout page.

Site features:
* A blog where visitors can read about lifestyle and training tips
* Clickable photos to learn more about each dog
* Easy browsability of all dogs up for adoption
* Pickup location options to facilitate the adoption process
* Easy to track totals if you plan to adopt more than one dog
* If first time adopter is selected in checkout, you will receive a free starter kit (leash, collar, etc.)

This site is designed to be responsive on all breakpoints and can be easily visited from a mobile device. Through rigorous testing, the Adoptadog website has confirmed strong cross-browser functionality. More details on the testing of the site can be found within testin.txt.
