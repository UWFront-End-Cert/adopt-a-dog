Project Implementation:
Created HTML and CSS
Linked JavaScript to web pages inside my HTML.
Created click handlers with alerts and these alerts display the information of each dog when a website user is clicking on the photos of each dog.
Created click handlers on the adoption button of each dog, that will add to the total.
Alert created - Webpage will alert the total.
Added media queries to the course project: Layout of dog photos changes from 3 columns to 1 on mobile devices. Layout of dog photos changes from 3 columns to 2 on tablet devices dog images are sized to look appropriate, On the home webpage, it will only show the blog article previews on iPad size and above. On mobile, the blog previews will not be displayed.
Added a background image, using the background-image CSS property. Photo should adjust to look appropriate on all viewport sizes. Used the background-image property to show the header image.
Ensured that all the other elements on the page display appropriately as the header image changes.
Added a gradient to the header. This will not be visible unless the web user disables the background-image property.
Responsivity - Images and elements are responsive and scale without issue
Refactored the blog page to generate the blog posts dynamically from JavaScript.
Checkout web page should display an alert that says "Thank you. The form information has been received" when the form has been submitted.
console.log the values inside the form
Included jQuery properly - Fade effect on dog tiles, Click event on adopt tiles, Total from cart is tracked
Used jQuery to update the checkout total on the index page with each click of an adopt button. Effect will not persist if you refresh or navigate to a new page, this is expected.
Utilized HTML validator and CSS validator
