## Synopsis:

### This is a 'replica' from the original source provided by this educational institution.

### This is a fictional website which simulates an e-commerce site with the particularity of a non-profit company, being an adoption agency. 

### This agency strictly follows "animal rights" by offering every rescued puppy a second opportunity to live a better life with a new owner.

### Adopt A Dog agency is located in Seattle, Wa. Although, there are two store locations available: one in Tacoma, and the second in Everett area, where you can easily pick up your favorite puppy.

### As an adoption agency, we are deeply concerned in animal walfare, especifically in our 'dogs'. So be aware, we accept purchases from all US territory but, unfortunely, we are not responsible to send by mail your selected item.

### Our personnel are absolutely supportive and proffessional, they are able to provide you as a client the best customer service have you ever experienced.


### So do not hesitate and come to see us. Our facilities follow state ordinance licenses and also all health and safety 'co-vid' protocols, too.   

### Thanks for trusting us.

### Mindfully,


Adopt A Dog management Dpt.
