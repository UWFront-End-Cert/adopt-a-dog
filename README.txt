Description:
The Adoptadog website was designed in Chrome and functions in Firefox, Edge, and Chrome for Android. Other browsers yet to be tested. 
Adoptadog is a website for prospective dog owners in the Pacific Northwest region to browse adoptable dogs and submit an application to adopt. Also included is a Blog with informational articles that prospective and seasoned dog owners may find helpful and enjoyable to read. 
The website is written to be responsive on a range of devices and screen resolutions. 

Notes: This project is not yet complete and requires further learning and experimentation. I hope to have the site fully functional soon and move forward creating more websites.
