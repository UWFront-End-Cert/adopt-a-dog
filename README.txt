Description: Adopt-a-Dog is a dog adoption website and content blog. We feature dogs currently available for adoption and a way to submit a request for dog adoption through the website directly!

Platforms: Adopt-a-Dog will render on all platforms, however desktop web on any operating system has the highest fidelity. We expect to enhance mobile CSS in future releases.
