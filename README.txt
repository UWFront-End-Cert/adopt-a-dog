Welcome to my very first website. Its serves mainly two purposes : simulate a real world building-a-website-for-a-cliente scenerio and do demonstrate what I have learned so far
in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a very basic website, built from the ground up using vanilla javascript and no frame works. I primarily used VsCode to build this website, which I prefer over Atom. (VScode makes CSS a little easier, I think, the color picker and previews are great). 

For this project, we were given I mock up of a site to emmulate for a local dog placement agency. We were given all the images in a seperate image file. The goal was to try to 
make your website resemble the mock up as closely as possible simply using a text editor and vanilla HTML5, no frameworks allowed. As you can see my site has four pages; a 
homepage, a page containing all the adoptable dogs, and blog page, and a cart page. 

The Javascript included only really deals with basic front end functionality. I use javascript to add the button effect to the homepage, add up the total of the cart, display a
particular dogs bio when clicked on, to add a new blog post to the blog page, and I used JQuery to validate the form on the cart/checkout page. Although this code is only really 
dealing with basic front-end tasks, I believe it was really good practice for back-end when it comes time to learn that. 

I included media queries for iphones and ipads so my site renders well on those devices from what I've tested. 

There are still a few small responsiviness tid-bits that could be rendered better, but I'm hoping in the future when I start using frameworks this will really stream line the process, put this assignment has given me a great understanding of how grid, flex-box, and media quereis should be deployed when considering responsive design
