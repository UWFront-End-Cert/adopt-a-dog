Adopt-A-Dog Website

This website was created as part of the University of Washington Front End Development Certificate Program. This website is for a Seattle-area dog adoption agency that looks to place dogs of all ages and conditions in loving homes throughout the Pacific Northwest. This website allows users to look at all dogs available for adoption, their breed, and cost of adoption. The site also includes a blog that features resources on topics such as traveling with your new companion, walking etiquette, and training.
