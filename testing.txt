User Research


Testing Devices / Browsers - 
Testing was done on a Windows desktop and an Iphone 12. On the desktop, I tested Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox. 
On the iphone I tested Google chrome and Safari.

Windows Desktop Tests - Using each browser’s mobile viewer, I resized the website from the largest to smallest devices. I 
checked that images and text were all presented reasonably on the screen as it was resized. In particular, I focused on verifying
that dog image sizes and spacing between dog images were adequate.

Findings - The web pages didn’t have significant differences between browsers. Images and text had resized similarly between browsers.
The text under “Adopt A Dog” in index.html should have line spacing to improve readability. On monitors with greater than 1440p width,
the dog images in dogs.html will have a layout of 2 rows of 5 dogs and 1 row of 2 dogs which looks strange. It would be better to limit
the max number of dogs per row to 4 so that there is always an equal number of dogs on each row. When the submit.html page is resized
to 320p width or below, there is white space below the footer. That is undesirable because there is no more content past the footer so 
it is confusing to the user.

Iphone 12 Tests - On Chrome and Safari I viewed all pages of the website (with standard 100% zoom) to see the content was well sized 
(text was easy to read, links and buttons were easy to click, images were large enough). I tested the hover shadow effect on the dog 
images as well as the dynamic cart updating from pressing the adopt buttons.

Findings - The green adopt buttons are small and the button text is small as well. The website loads focused in on the top left of 
the page. It’s necessary to pan out (not zoom out) of the page so that the entire web page is viewable. It is undesirable behavior 
because it is confusing when first navigating to the website. Most of the content is readable and it is possible to navigate between 
links on mobile, however, the website would benefit from having larger icons and article text. The shadow effect on dog images is 
not obvious in the webpage. If you weren’t looking for it, it wouldn’t be noticeable. The cart updated its total value without issue 
when selecting multiple dogs. I didn’t observe any significant differences in viewing the website between safari and chrome.

Fixes - I did not incorporate fixes to my findings due to limited time. One issue that I found interesting was the submit page’s white
space past the footer. The footer is not different between that page and others so I could not determine what was causing that issue.
