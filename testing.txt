=== TESTING ===

- Firefox
Website functions as intended in Firefox. Rendering of a few buttons are not
what it is desired. No changes made as it maintains functionality.

- Chrome
Website functions as intended in Chrome. It was developed with it in mind.

- Edge
Website functions with odd behaviors. Padding and margins do not behave as
intended. Home page shows dog selection to be showing in a row 2 cards wide -
it should be 3 cards wide. Similar with dog profiles page, what was supposed
to be 4 cards wide is only 3 cards wide. Cards' "Adopt" button does not
turn blue as intended. No changes intended as fixes conflict with those optimized
for Chrome. 64% of the market is dominated by Chrome vs 4% of Edge. Not
top priority.

CORRECTION: was using laptop - developed in widescreen PC. Card width row issue
is no longer applicable. Still having issue with "Adopt" color change.

- Mobile Safari
Website exhibits uninted behavior. Website does not collapse into single column
on landing page. Similar behavior on other changes. Tweaks to media breakpoints
needed immediately.

=== USER RESEARCH ===

- Karen
Karen is a middle aged woman who owns an iPhone, an iPad, and spends lots of time
on Facebook sharing dog memes. She lives in Bellevue and works at a local health
clinic. Besides dogs, getting frappuccinos as Starbucks with her friends is her 
passion. 

The website would benefit to add social media buttons and have automatic
location identification (where permitted and allowed) to automatically fill in
the pickup location. Making sure that there is a strong social media presence
with keywords referencing dogs and coffee, we would see stronger traffic and
higher chance of adoptions for dogs. Developing for the MacOs and Safari is a
must.

- Chad
Chad is a former government employee working for the Seattle school district. 
He is a middle aged man who values his privacy a lot and even installed Linux 
to limit data trail. He uses IceWeasel as his browser. His only known social
media presence is Reddit where he complains about Game of Thrones after season 6.
He references his dog a lot in his posts and calls him The Hound.

Users like Brad would not benefit from a strong social media presence, but donate
a lot to charitable causes like animal rescue though they may not adopt. Having a
donate button as an alternative to adoption would strongly help the financial
position of the shelter. Users like Chad gravitate to Firefox and Chrome engine.

- Kyle
Kyle is a young college student currently looking for a long term relationship.
Accesses the website almost exclusively through his cell phone. As a way to pursue
his passion, dogs, he volunteers at the shelter and brings dates to get to know
the dogs better. Though he is not a current prospective owner, he may adopt in 
the long term and is able to take dogs on outings.

Expanding the website to include non-committal walks and exercises, we would be able
to further expand the pool of adopters. Recommend to add page "Walk Me" will aid
in our mission. A schedule for internal purposes will need to be created and
for client side selection.
