TESTING

I started my testing process by checking my website on different web platforms,
such as Google Chrome, Safari and Firefox, as well as on Mac and Windows.
Unfortunately, I was not able to test it on a tablet or a phone, since the page would not load.
However, I tested different sizes on my browser in inspect.

I did come with some issues that needed to be fixed:

- Header on the index page was not working properly. I found that the issue was in media queries,
I had a fixed width in there. Once I completely removed it, it worked as expected.

- Button on an index page did not look properly on mobile screen size.
It was fixed and now looks consistent throughout different sizes.

- Checkout page was not mobile friendly at all,
media queries and some work in css made it look consistent on all device sizes and now is mobile friendly.

- Blog page was not mobile friendly as well. I reorganized my css and media queries and now it works as expected on all sizes.

The rest of the stuff works as expected and no additional changes are needed.
