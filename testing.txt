User persona:
    Name: Dan Baegler
    Occupation: Data Analyst
    Education: Master's degree
    Bio: Dan has two young children, a full-time job, a spouse with a demanding full-time job, loads of resposibilities, and 
    precious little free time. He uses Google Chrome on his work late-model HP laptop, Mozilla Firefox on his personal 2023 Macbook Pro, 
    and Safari on his iPhone 7. He is tech savvy but short on time and prone to frustration. He wants to adopt a dog for 
    his children, and is primarily concerned with finding a dog that is a puppy, fairly cute, and that is good with children.
    He will want to be able to rapidly scan through the available dogs to find one he likes according to their picture and brief
    description. He wants the checkout process to be simple and straight-forward, should be choose to adopt.

Testing:
1) Google Chrome on HP laptop:
    -Pros: Pictures of dogs are nicely sized
           Easy to checkout and add dog to cart
    -Cons: Header is blank and way too big. Have to scroll excessively to get to content.
    -Changes Made: Added comments to shrink header - eventually will make changes when CSS is written.
2) Mozilla Firefox on Macbook Pro:
    -Very similar browsing experience to Google Chrome on the HP laptop. Dog pictures are appropriately sized but header is excessively
    and distracting lage.
3) Safari on iPhone 7:
    -Cons: Pictures of dogs are excessively large and are larger than the screen width
           Buttons ("Checkout," "See More Dogs") are tiny and hard to push
           Links and buttons are too small and close together - easy to accidentally push the wrong link or button
    - Fixes: Added comments to resize photos responsively, increase button/link size, and increase spacing between links/buttons.
