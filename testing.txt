Testing Notes

I expect that most of the people who access this site will be 25-40 year old
single urban Millenials. In my experience, urban millenials are highly likely to delay 
childbearing and instead adopt a pet for companionship, particularly in their 20s and 
early 30s while they are focusing on a carreer. They are also likely to look online
for a pet instead of going through the usual channels like a local shelter. 


Most of these people will be technologically literate and will use
a smart phone to browse sites while at work and a laptop or desktop browser,
likely Mozilla or Google Chrome, while at home. They may also use
an Apple or Samsung Tablet while laying at home in bed to surf sites. 
They will probably not use Internet Explorer in their personal lives. 

I tested this project on desktop on Mozilla, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge. Basic functionality
was present in all browsers - images loaded and jquery was functional. However, there were 
still nagging issues with image elements in the header not resizing quite right. I think
this is something I will have to revisit in future sites. 

I tested on my phone (Samsung S9). On mobile, the dog images went to one column, but I still had trouble
getting them exactly centered in the phone. Additionally, the issues with small header images persisted.

I used Google Chrome's Responsive mode to simulate a tablet. On tablet, the dogs showed up in two 
columns as I expected, and issues with header resizing were less of an issue.
