Testing
In order to test the Website, I took the following steps:

  Viewed the Website using Chrome, Safari, and Firefox
  Viewed the Website on a mobile device
  Viewed the Website on a Mac

When testing the website, I verified that the text and images were aligned properly,
the clickable areas were suitable, and that the shading and colors were consistent across
all devices.  I also made sure that any text, images, etc did not run into the edges of the
screen and that all the pages were readable no matter which devices were used.

Although I started out verifying the responsiveness of the website using developer tools,
I did also check the responsiveness of the website on a laptop and mobile device.
