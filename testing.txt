Research

Research shows that:
-Majority of the site users are English speaking, so the site’s language will be English.
    -After English the 4 most common languages spoken in Seattle are Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese and Tagalog (Filipino), so I will eventually add support for these languages.
-Site users use either OSX or Windows to access the site on desktop devices and iPhones/iPad or Androids for mobile devices.
-Users access the site using the following browsers:
    -OSX: Safari, Chrome and Firefox
    -Windows: Edge
    -iOS (iPhone/iPad): Safari
    -Android: Chrome
-Some of the site’s users have disabilities, so I will want to make the site accessible
    -Large, easy to click links (especially for the mobile site)
    -Easy to read text for the visually impaired
    -Screen reader compatibility and using alt text for the visually impaired

Testing

--

W3C Validation

W3C Markup Validation:
Ran full website through the validator and it had no errors. It did get a warning saying “This document appears to be Lorem ipsum text but the html start tag has lang="en". Consider using lang="zxx" (or variant) instead.” This warning is helpful, but the Lorem ipsum text is just a place holder until I write the actual body copy for the website, which I will do once the site is fully designed and functioning properly.

-

W3C CSS Validation:
Not run, as I have not added CSS yet to the site. I will be adding CSS soon and I will then run the validator.
