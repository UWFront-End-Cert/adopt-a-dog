Adopt-a-Dog Website Testing Document

Revisions:
5/19/2024: created testing document, user base cross-section, and tested on multiple devices. Integrate results below.

User base cross-section and needs:
-People who seek to adopt a dog in the greater Seattle area, either mostly online, or in-person at one of our locations. Support for individuals to take their transaction offline, such as contact info and location info, required
-Users mostly viewing from mobile devices (Apple, Samsung, Google Pixel), then tablet/laptops, then desktop computers. Development will be proportionately distributed to 65% mobile, 20% tablet and laptop, and 15% desktop. Support will be needed for Chrome, Edge, Safari, and Firefox
-Age ranges include anyone able to access the internet, however, credit card checkout will be limited to adults
-Support for screen reader required per Adopt-a-Dog LLC

Testing results:
Functionality testing metrics and results:
-CSS fail, implementation scheduled for end of May/early June 2024.
-JS fail, implementation scheduled for middle June 2024.
-Confirmed through w3 html validator that there are no syntactical HTML errors and all HTML is semantic. 
-Intra-site links fail, update before 5/26/24
-Form testing: submit button functionality to be implemented mid June 2024
 
Accessibility testing metrics and results:
-WCAG checklist score: WCAG 2.0 AA rating per websiteaccessibiltychecker.com
-Contrast rating to be updated upon completion of styling
-Keyboard navigable page fail, TBD
-Screen reader naviagable page partial fail, scheduled with completion of CSS
-Zoom test levels 50%-200% pass with no remarkable results

Performance testing metrics and results:
Thanks to Britt Rohrer for recommending Google Lighthouse as a benchmark tool.
-Lighthouse testing showed 100 for performance, 93 for accessiblity, 96 for best practices, and 82 for SEO. Consider approach to make links crawlable and to give document a meta description to improve SEO rating. Check again pending styling and screen reader implementations.

Compatibility testing metrics and results:
(Note these results are pre-CSS implementation. Suggest considerations for 4 or 6 bootstrap standard viewport sizes and flexbox or grid formatting of elements to prevent stacking and overflow)
-Browser/device combinations:
--Lenovo Chromebook with Android Chrome- unremarkable results
--Google Pixel 8 with mobile Chrome- unremarkable results
--Apple Macbook Air with Safari- unremarkable results
--Windows 11 desktop with firefox- zip code box is formatted as a number and has up/down arrows next to it, atypical. read firefox documentation and consider a browser query if needed
--Chrome DevTools emulating Iphone SE- dropdown menu for state select on checkout.html seems to cover upper part of screen rather than whole screen, not functionally remarkable
