User Persona:
Name: Jeremy Williams
Age: 32
Occupation: Account Manager
Salary: $90,000
Education: Bachelor's Degree
Bio: Jeremy is a married father of 2 young children, and his family has become interested in adopting a pet. Jeremy is tech-savvy, and feels financially secure enough to adopt a pet, but his family would be new to dog ownership. They still want to adopt a rescue rather than buy from a breeder, so Jeremy has certain particulars in mind for breeds & temperaments that would be a good fit for an inexperienced family with small children.
Challenges: The site should prioritize navigability in listings & corresponding info, and present information in a way that is up-front and intuitive, as this user is often strapped for time, and could opt for another service if he feels his options here can't be evaluated efficiently enough.
Additionally, Jeremy is red-green colorblind, so ensuring proper color contrast everywhere on the site, and including detailed alt text descriptions on photos (particularly visual descriptions of dogs listed on the platform) is essential.
Device info: Owns a 6 month-old smartphone (browses with Safari) and a 2 year-old laptop (browses with Firefox). Occasionally browses on his work desktop using Chrome.
