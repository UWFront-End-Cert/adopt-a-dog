Users likely come from a variety of backgrounds. We should have full mobile and tablet support in addition to desktop support on the primary browsers. The site does not take much memory so it should load easily on most internets. Most people in Seattle probably do not use dial up internet. If users from more rural areas show interest in the site, testing on dial up might make sense. Site is simple and easy to use and most users should have no trouble using it, as long as it loads. 

TESTING:

To ensure quality, tested on Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. Appears functional and no obvious differences between different browers. Should work on most desktops. Tested on tablet (iPad Air 2) and iPhone 6. On tablet, index was a little cramped so adjusted spacing. Everything else appears fine. On phone, blog page has bad sizing. Not entirely sure what to change - perhaps scale the image down and change the font size of the blog post. Tested on PC (using Chrome). Again no differences, appeared fully functional.

STYLE:

Site is simple without complex colors. Header image and slogan look good and declare the purpose of the site. White is used as the background color, a common theme in many sites. Green is used for the buttons, which creates an overall relaxing appearance. Main page offers quick access to blogs for curious users. Dogs page continues themes of main page. Blogs page is not significantly different. Overall, site is simple and easy on the eyes.
