Users:
    The user base for this project would mainly be people looking to adopt a new dog.
    This can include many different types and ages of people, most likely at least in their twenties.
    This means there is also a wide range of technological knowledge in the user base, so the site shoud be easy enough for anyone to navigate.
    Plenty of the users would likely be younger and more technologically savvy, and would like the site to be neat and quick to learn. 

Devices:
    Devices used would probably consist mainly of smartphones and laptops, many people are likely looking for dogs in their downtime or on the go.
    The browsers used would mostly be Chrome, Safari, Edge, and Firefox, but occasionally older browsers like Internet Explorer as well.
    The website should be reponsive on all these browsers, as well as screen sizes from smaller smartphones to larger pcs.
    It should be clear, concise, and attractive to be as appealing to the user base as possible.

Testing:
    I tested this site on my Windows laptop using Chrome, Firefox, Brave, and Edge.
    I used the Chrome window resizer extension to view what the site would look like on different screen sizes. 
    I also tested it on my iPhone using Safari.
    The text sizing and color seemed to be the same on each browser and device, as well as the layout of the site.
    The images remained in the correct order and part of the site, even when changing the window size.
    The site will definitely need to be tested again after the CSS is added, using all the browsers and separate devices.
    I used the W3C HTML validation service to ensure that my code was valid and didn't have any errors. 
    I had to adjust the buttons and form sections of the site after running it through W3C to avoid HTML errors, and it was all valid the second time around.
