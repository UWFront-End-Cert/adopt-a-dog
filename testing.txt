Testing Devices and Browsers -
Testing was done on a Windows Laptop and an Android Smartphone. On the laptop, I tested Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Firefox.
On the Android Smartphone, I tested on Google Chrome.

Windows Laptop Testing - I tried testing the webpages on all three of the browsers. I resized them to every device from laptop to smartphone.
It looked like the writing did not matter for the three browsers I tested on. The Google Chrome was my default browser, so I had to change my default
browser to a different one every time I wanted to test a different browser. I was not able to test Safari, since Apple no longer publicly offers it to
other operating systems. Overall, the testing results on the different browsers did not have me see differences.

Android Smartphone Testing - When I tested my pages on the smartphone with Chrome on an Android OS. The pages load zoomed in at start, but I can zoom back out. Overall the pages were
not difficult for me to browse with. Some of the words were pretty small, but I can zoom in to make them bigger. The blog pictures were still the same percentage
width on the smartphone. The cards were still only one card per row. The entire card layout was a column. So, the smartphone testing seemed very like when I resized
for the smartphone on my laptop. The smartphone test results did not make a huge difference in the smartphone resize on laptop.

Findings - I found that you are already very prepared for other browsers and devices once you write the code out for your page with the set width. The other browsers
did not look any different for me. They all yielded a very identical result for me. However, I do not have an apple device, so I cannot be sure if my web pages worked
on Safari, since Safari is no longer officially available for non iOS devices. Only Apple products could access the iOS. But overall, I thought the browsers results were
pretty much the same.
