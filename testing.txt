Testing for Adoptadog
Mike Watters HTML200 Class Project

I tested the site in the following browsers and devices.

Desktop:
- Chrome (Mac/PC)
- Edge (PC)
- Safari (Mac)
- Firefox (Mac/PC)

Mobile:
- Safari iOS on iPhone 6S, iPhone XR, and iPad 7
- Google Chrome for Android on Galaxy S7 Edge

On all desktop browsers, there were two issues with the design of the site.
First, on the "Dogs" page, there was a lot of extra white space on the righthand
side of the page. It was using the same container class as the homepage;
however, the "Dogs" page doesn't have a blog preview. I created a new class
called ".all-dog-container" to extend the container width on that page to 100%
and make the dog tiles fill out the space. Second, based on feedback from the
instructor, I reduced spacing on the "Checkout" page form for tablet and desktop
viewing.

In Firefox on the PC, links inside the elements for "Checkout", "See more dogs",
and "Visit the blog" did not work. I changed the tag on those elements from
<button> to a more semantically appropriate <div> tag.

In Firefox on Mac, <select> buttons are functional but not ideal looking. After
some experimentation and no improvement, I decided to leave those buttons as-is,
since they worked functionally and there are probably not a ton of users of this
browser on Mac.

The site was built using progressive enhancement, so it tested well on mobile
devices, and I didn't make any additional changes for mobile users.
