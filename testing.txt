Tested Site on Multiple Browsers:
- Chrome - alert boxes work,
- Safari
  - alert boxes work and actually look nicer than on chrome!
  - responsiveness - Header doesn't break down as small as the chrome browser. Doesn't look bad so no changes made.
- Firefox
  - responsiveness - this browser allows you to go to smaller widths so it does size down to mobile width nicely.
  - responsiveness - needed to change up classes on form to resize properly - adjustment was needed because originally coded to size down from desktop rather than size up from mobile.
