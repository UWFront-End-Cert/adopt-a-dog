Testing Requirements
-------------------------------------
To ensure consistent user experiences across a variety of devices the following environments are considered:

Browsers:
- Microsoft Edge
- Microsoft Internet Explorer (older users might not have upgraded)
- Chrome
- Safari

Devices:
- Android Phone (smaller screen)
- iPad
- Laptop (resolution 3000 x 2000)
- 4K Monitor (resolution 3840 x 2160)

The devices have been selected to meet general user needs and based on the personas defined in the User-Persona.doc (.pdf)

Testing Procedures
-------------------------------------
To ensure a consistent experience there are several tests that should be performed.  The tests have been divided into two groups,
the first set is to ensure the site renders correctly across all of the browsers, the second is device support with a focus on 
responsive design based on the user device.

1. Browser Compatability Testing

        Browsers can have different levels of support for html5, css, and javascript support.  The purposes of these tests are to identify
        that all of the browsers present the user with same website experience.  The following items need to be checked for each of the browsers:

        Index.html
        - Layout matches design renders
        - Navigation bar directs to the correct pages.
        - Selecting a dog image prompts an alert: provides name, breed, adoption cost for dog selected.
        - Clicking the adopt button for a dog updates the cart total in the header
        - If blog posts are in sidebar, then the link takes user to blog.html

        dogs.html
        - Layout matches design renders
        - Navigation bar directs to the correct pages.
        - Selecting a dog image prompts an alert: provides name, breed, adoption cost for dog selected.
        - Clicking the adopt button for a dog updates the cart total in the header

        blog.html
        - Layout matches design renders
        - Navigation bar directs to the correct pages.

        checkout.html
        - Layout matches design renders
        - Navigation bar directs to the correct pages.
        - Selecting submit alerts the user that the form data has been accepted.  Console logs the information.

2. Device Compatability Testing

        Users may interact with the site from a variety of devices.  The interaction can be performed with either a touchscreen or a mouse.
        Devices also have different screen sizes and resolution which can drive different views of page.  The pages should be responsive and adapt
        to the various sizes.

        All devices
        - Images should be properly scaled to view.
        - Buttons and links should be easy to interact with.
        - Text should be scalable for readability.
        - Landscape view, Index page should have two columns of dogs with sidebar blog

        Device Specific Tests
        Android Phone
        - Pages should present with single column view.  This applies to index, dogs, and blog pages.

        iPad
        - Dogs posting should be limited to two columns
        - Index page should have two columns of dogs with sidebar blog

        Laptop/Monitor
        - Dogs posting should be three columns 
        - Index page should have three columns of dogs with sidebar blog

Testing Notes

Current pages meet all of the testing and design requirements.

Future Development Enhancements
- Adopted dogs are not stored for the user session, moving to a new page does not retain the selections
- The form is not validated prior to submiting.  Error need to be trapped to ensure proper information is gathered.
