The site was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Safari.

The site now appears as expected on all 3 browsers.

There were some issues on mobile, however:

- The dogs section of the original site exceeded the width of the mobile screen and so I had to reduce the margins of the article, as well as decrease the size of the dog images in order to ensure that all the dog tiles fit in the screen on mobile.

- There was also an issue on mobile, in which the blog images would appear vertically stretched upon rendering. Although I could not determine the exact cause of this, I was able to fix the issue by putting the blog images in their own div and then specifying the width of each blog image in-line.
