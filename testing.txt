Testing steps:
First, test all pages/functionality via desktop in Chrome, Firefox, Edge.

Then, view the site in Chrome dev tools.
Test all pages/functionality on all of the mobile modes first, then test the rotate mode with each.
Then test all pages/functionality with the tablets, then test the rotate mode with each.

Then, test all pages/functionality with any devices, if you have them. I tested with iPhone 11 and a new iPad.

Fix bugs as they are found, then resume all testing steps above to ensure there are no new bugs or regression.

The main bug found during this testing process involved tablets in landscape mode. The media query for tablets was adjusted to incorporate the widest pixel width for the iPad Pro. Other bugs included resizing the checkout dog images and including bottom margin for the dog cards in the mobile media query.
