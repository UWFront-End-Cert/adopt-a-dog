User Personas:

  Based on my research, the user base for the Adopt-a-dog website are as follows:
    -Mostly female.
    -Younger married couples with or without kids.
    -Have owned are cared for dogs before.
    -Educated and have researched the challenges of adopted dogs versus say, purchasing a puppy.
    -Middle class to upper class with some degree of expendable time.
    -People comfortable with e-commerce.
    -Own at least (1) each of a laptop computer and smart phone. Some may have multiple computers, such as 1 for work and 1 for
    personal use, as well as a tablet such as an iPad.
    -On laptop, they are likely to use Chrome, Firefox and Safari web browsers over Edge, Internet Explorer and Opera.

Testing:

  To ensure site quality, I have performed the following:
    -Utilized progressive enhancement by designing with mobile in mind, then adding for desktop.
    -Tested website on Chrome, Firefox and IE on a 15.5" PC. Looked at each page in the website and resized to ensure that dog tiles, background
    images, etc. all adjusted appropriately to maintain readibility.
    -Used Chrome Dev Tools to simulate presentation on different phones.
    -Ensured standard font and color across all pages.
    -Ensured text did not become unreadably tiny for any view.
    -Ensured horizontal scroll bar was not present for any mobile view or device.
