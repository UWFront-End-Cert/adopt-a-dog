Lesson 10 Assignment2

User Persona Description
	Based on a quick research in three sites our user persona description for our website is targeting the millenial generation today.
	Some research data shows that 93% of millenials own smartphones and 70% of millenials owns a laptop. According to reasearch millenials
	are more likely and the first generation to own a laptop.

Testing Details
	Tested the pages on a laptop in three different browsers (Google Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge) the pages were consistent in all 
	three. Also tested the page on an android device and it was consistent with the browsers on a laptop when reducing the sizes. A lot 
	of improvements	can be done on the styling for the smarth phone, for users to have a better experience when visiting the site. Also used 
	chrome developer tools.     
	
	Through out the course project learned that using css, js and jquery have many advantages for designing webpages and things can be done in many
	different ways. Also even though sometimes things seem to be simple it takes a lot of effort to get them work properly.
