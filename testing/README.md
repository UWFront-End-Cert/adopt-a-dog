# Adopt-a-Dog Website

This website allows users to browse and select dogs available for adoption.
Photos and biographies for each dog are organized in cards, which provide
the option to reserve the chosen dog by adding its fee to a shopping cart.
User details and payment are collected on a checkout page. There is also a
blog featuring articles from various contributors about pet care, training
and other aspects of dog ownership. The purpose of this site is to allow
those interested in dog adoption to take their time learning about each animal
and make decisions on their own schedule, rather than having to spend hours
traveling to various shelters trying to find a good match.
