User Persona -
  “The PNW Transplant”

  The PNW Transplant is an adult - single, in a relationship, or married - who lives in the Greater Seattle Area. They live an active lifestyle and definitely have every parks pass needed to get out on the weekends. They have a small group of close friends, a job that keeps them fairly busy (hybrid in office and remote), and are tech savvy. They make a decent salary, and want to add a new addition to their life, but aren’t quite ready mentally or financially for a child. Instead, they browse for new furry companions at work in their downtime, on their smartphone on the bus, and at home on the couch, and plan to adopt, not shop, for a pet.
