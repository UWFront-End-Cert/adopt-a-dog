User persona: 

Age range: Probably skews older and those with disposable income that can afford a pet, but also frugal enough to not buy an animal from a puppy mill. 30-60 is probably the sweet spot. 

Types of people: Families and animal lovers. 

Testing needed: Due to the wide range of potential users, there needs to be testing on a variety of browsers and on a variety of computers. There are some older people using the site that still use Microsoft Browsers like Edge and Internet Explorer, while younger users are more partial to Chrome and Firefox. Most users have a PC, but some have a Mac. Many users use mobile devices like tablets and phones. 

Testing objectives: Our users are seeking ease of use above all else. We need our site to be accessible for several different people to ensure competition does not go else where to seek adoption. 

Testing plan: Test on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Safari (all on Laptop

Test on a iPad, iPhone and a Android Phone. 


Test Execution: 

Google Chrome on (Mac): Site was originally designed based on a Chrome Browser, so the site is responsive and functional. Everything operates as it’s intended to do. 

Google Chrome on (PC): I wasn’t able to download an emulator because the disk space on my Mac is so full and unfortunately I wasn’t able to find a PC device to test this one (we only have apple products). Feel free and take a few points off but I don’t know how to do. 

Safari on Mac: The site performs almost identically as it would on Google Chrome. The only noticeable difference are the buttons are slightly different. 

Safari on PC:  I wasn’t able to download an emulator because the disk space on my Mac is so full and unfortunately I wasn’t able to find a PC device to test this one (we only have apple products). Feel free and take a few points off but I don’t know how to do. 

Microsoft Edge on Mac: The site performs identically to its performance on google chrome. 

Microsoft Edge on PC:  I wasn’t able to download an emulator because the disk space on my Mac is so full and unfortunately I wasn’t able to find a PC device to test this one (we only have apple products). Feel free and take a few points off but I don’t know how to do. 

On iPhoneX: The Site performs very well, especially with the media queries set for the Home screen and the Dog Card pages. The Blog posts are slightly offcenter due to margins. The checkout page looks slightly clunky because the email address input is on two lines where everything else is on one line (simply changing the label to “email” would probably do the trick. On Chrome Dev Tools, it’s impossible to scroll down to the footer on all of the pages. The NavBar looks a little squished, but it’s not terrible. 



On iPad: The site performs quite well. There’s no obvious issues, other than it’s hard to scroll down and see the footer. 

On Google Pixel 2 XL: The site is slightly clunky. The nav bar extends across horizontally, but doesn’t fit all the way across so the “blog” tab floats down to the left. The checkout page pops up, which isn’t common for most mobile devices and there’s no space between the right side of the header and the button, which looks awkward. The blog pages show up very well, centered and inline. The checkout page form looks a little too off-center, but not terrible. Like the other two devices, the site does not scroll down for the footer. 




Overall thoughts: The site performed really well on myriad devices, with some quirks in the UX setup but the javascript performed well on everything we tested. The site was easy to use for all users and easy to navigate.
